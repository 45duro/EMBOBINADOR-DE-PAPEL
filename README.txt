# Summary

This is a model of the leaning tower of Pisa. I recommend to rotate it with 4 degrees (that's the leaning) around the x-axis so that the baseplate is printed diagonally but the tower is printed straight. That looks much better when you put it up later than printed with a straight base plate and a leaning tower. 
I also recommend using supports but not too much, because it might be a sisyphean labour to get them our with a needle.

Edit - I added the cut version of the tower now. My picture shows the tower with bells printed seperately and glued into the top of the tower afterwards. This may be a bit tricky, but definitely makes printing easier as the whole tower prints without any use of support material. The 6 parts in the middle were printed 180 degrees rotated with pillars up, to avoid the use of support structure.
